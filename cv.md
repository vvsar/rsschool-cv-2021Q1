## About me  
A highly proficient and experienced chemist currently working for EPAM Systems. Although lacking IT education and experience, I like the opportunity to receive new knowledge and skills necessary for IT specialists. Possessing good interpersonal and synthetic skills, I am on the point of boosting the personal growth that may turn my life upside down.

  for (j = 0; j < items.length; j++) {
    if (pred(items[j]) == false) {
      arr.push(items[j]);
    } else {
      arr1.push(items[j]);
    }
  }
  let n = arr.length;
  arr = arr.concat(arr1);
  for (h = 0; h < items.length; h++) {
    items.shift();
    items.push(arr[h]);
